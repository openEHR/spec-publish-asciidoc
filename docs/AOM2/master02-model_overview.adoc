= Model Overview

The model described here is a pure object-oriented model that can be used with archetype parsers and software that manipulates archetypes and templates in memory. It is typically the output of a parser of any serialsed form of archetypes. It is dependent on the openEHR Base package classes.

== Package Structure

The openEHR Archetype Object Model is defined as the package `am.archetype` , as illustrated in Figure [[package_overview]]. It is shown in the context of the openEHR `am.archetype` packages.

== Definition and Utility Classes

=== Overview

Various definitional classes are used in the AOM. Some are defined in the `aom.definitions` package, while others come from the openEHR `definitions` package. These are illustrated below.

The enumeration type `VALIDITY_KIND` is provided in order to define standard values representing `mandatory`, `optional`, or `disallowed` in any model. It is used in this model in classes such as `C_DATE` , `C_TIME` and `C_DATE_TIME`. The `VERSION_STATUS` enumeration type serves a similar function within various AOM types.

Other classes used from the `base` package include `AUTHORED_RESOURCE` (openEHR `resource` package) and its subordinate classes. These are shown in full within the packages that use them.
