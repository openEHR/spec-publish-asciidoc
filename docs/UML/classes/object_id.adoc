|*Description*
{set:cellbgcolor:lightblue}
2+|Ancestor class of identifiers of informational objects. Ids may be completely  +
meaningless, in which case their only job is to refer to something, or may carry  +
some information to do with the identified object.  +
Object ids are used inside an object to identify that object. To identify another  +
object in another service, use an OBJECT_REF, or else use a UID for local objects  +
identified by UID. If none of the subtypes is suitable, direct instances of this class  +
may be used.
