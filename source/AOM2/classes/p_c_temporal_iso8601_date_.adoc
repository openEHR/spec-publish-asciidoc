|*Description*
{set:cellbgcolor:lightblue}
2+|ISO 8601-compatible constraint on instances of Date in the form either of a set of  +
validity values, or an actual date range. There is no validity flag for  year', since it  +
must always be by definition mandatory in order to have a sensible date at all.  +
Syntax expressions of instances of this class include  YYYY-??-??  (date with  +
optional month and day).  +
Date ranges are probably only useful for historical dates.
